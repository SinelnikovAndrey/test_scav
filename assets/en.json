            "firstPoint": "• Retrace Your Steps: Try to remember your last actions before you lost the item. Revisit the places you’ve been recently and check all possible locations carefully.",
            "secondPoint": "• Check the Most Obvious Places First: Lost items are often in plain sight or in areas where you commonly use them. Start your search in these locations.",
            "thirdPoint": "• Focus on One Item at a Time: If you’ve lost multiple items, don’t try to find them all at once. Prioritize finding one, then move on to the next."

            "firstPoint": "• Visualize: Close your eyes and imagine the last time you used the item. This mental picture might help you recall where you placed it.",
            "secondPoint": "• Think of the Last Seen Location: Consider where you last remember seeing or using the item. This gives you a good starting point for your search.",
            "thirdPoint": "• Relate to Sounds or Habits: Sometimes remembering a sound (like the jingle of keys) or a habitual action can help you locate an item. Did you put your keys down after hearing the door close?"

            "firstPoint": "• Check Hidden Areas: Items can easily fall between cushions, behind furniture, or be hidden under other objects. Inspect these areas thoroughly.",
            "secondPoint": "• Methodically Go Through Drawers or Bags: Slowly go through your drawers, bags, and shelves, one section at a time. Lost items often hide beneath or behind other belongings.",
            "thirdPoint": "• Use a Flashlight: If your item is small or in a dimly lit area, a flashlight can help you illuminate dark spaces where it might be hiding."

            "firstPoint": "• Designate a Spot for Each Item: To prevent future losses, create a designated spot for commonly misplaced items (like a hook for keys, a bowl for your wallet).",
            "secondPoint": "• Build a Habit of Double-Checking: Before leaving the house, develop a habit of checking for essential items like your phone, wallet, and keys. This will help reduce the chance of misplacing them.",
            "thirdPoint": "• Use Bright or Noticeable Markers: If you often misplace small items, attach bright keychains or labels to make them more noticeable."

            "firstPoint": "• Remember the Last Location: The app can store where an item was last seen or used. Use this feature to quickly narrow down your search.",
            "secondPoint": "• Take Photos of Items: If you’re prone to losing things, take pictures of where they are stored. This can serve as a visual reminder for future reference.",
            "thirdPoint": "• Set Reminders for Rarely Used Items: If there’s an item you don’t use daily, the app can remind you to check in on it periodically, preventing it from being forgotten entirely."

            "firstPoint": "• Stay Calm: Anxiety and stress can cloud your thinking and make it harder to find lost items. Take a deep breath and remain focused.",
            "secondPoint": "• Search in Steps: Don’t overwhelm yourself by trying to search your entire house at once. Break your search into smaller areas and focus on one spot at a time."

            "secondPoint": "• Develop Storage Habits: Train yourself to place frequently lost items, such as your phone or keys, in the same spot every time you get home."

            "firstPoint": "• Ask Others: If you can’t find something, ask people around you if they’ve seen it. Sometimes another person’s perspective can reveal what you’ve missed.",
            "secondPoint": "• Get Friends to Help: If you’re searching in a public place or a large area, ask friends to help you search to cover more ground."

            "firstPoint": "• Delaying the Search: Start looking for the lost item as soon as you realize it’s missing. The sooner you start searching, the better your chances of finding it.",
            "secondPoint": "• Skipping Over Areas: Be sure to thoroughly check places you’ve already looked. Items can often be overlooked in the first search."

            "secondPoint": "• Phone: Use a specific charging station to always know where your phone is.",
            "thirdPoint": "• Wallet: Keep your wallet in a consistent pocket or drawer when not in use.",
            "forthPoint": "• Glasses: Place them in a case when not wearing them, in a specific spot to avoid losing them."
